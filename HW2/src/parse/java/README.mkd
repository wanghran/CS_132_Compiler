# Setting up the parse source files

To set up the parse source files you have to first run JTB on the
`minijava.jj` file, and then build the class files using JavaCC. The
procedure is pretty simple:

   java -jar ../../../misc/jtb132.jar ../../../grammars/minijava.jj
   java -cp ../../../misc/javacc.jar javacc jtb.out.jj

These files will be compiled and is available to you when using `gradle
build` and `gradle run`.

DO NOT INCLUDE THESE FILES IN YOUR TAR.
